/*
	(0.9.8)
	* Changed name of the mod and git repo to event_info, away from event_manager_info.
	* Changed font color in most of the UI to not be the bright yellow title font.
	* Events that may reward a bro are now assigned the shiny bright yellow font. Gone is the green font.
	* Fixed issue where some events would display many decimal places.
	* Adjusted summary text from "Chance for a brother" to "Chance for a brother event to fire".
	* Expanded the tooltip that appears when hovering over the "Chance for a brother event to fire" text showing the actual chance for an event plus the real chance to score a new brother.
	* Removed all decimal places from the UI except for the chance for an event bro event.
	* Fixed issue where the "On Cooldown" events had incorrect values for Fired On Day and Available On Day.
	* Change decimal display values of On Cooldown events to "Day - TimeOfDay" format in a way that matches the world clock.
	* Added Blighted Guy 1 event to the list of bro events that have a partial success chance to reward a bro when the event fires.
	* Fixed issue where crises events were always obscured, regardless of MSU Setting.
	* Fixed issue where some bro events that include the word 'crises' were being obfuscated.

	Something interesting that I've discovered while working on the event manager mod days / time of day. There are two clocks running behind the scenes. A virtual clock that is tied to things like events. A world map clock that is visual to the player. These two clocks grow further apart over time.

	todo
	. Add logic to process events in the cooldown list
	. Create tooltips
	. Fix issue where the filter box arrests attention away from the keybinds
