/*
	(0.9.8)
	#Major Changes / New Features
	* Changed name of the mod and git repo to event_info, away from event_manager_info.
	* Change decimal display values of On Cooldown events to "Day - TimeOfDay" format in a way that matches the world clock.

	#UI Changes
	* Changed font color in most of the UI to not be the bright yellow title font.
	* Events that may reward a bro are now assigned the shiny bright yellow font. Gone is the green font.
	* Adjusted summary text from "Chance for a brother" to "Chance for a brother event to fire".
	* Expanded the tooltip that appears when hovering over the "Chance for a brother event to fire" text showing the actual chance for an event plus the real chance to score a new brother.
	* Removed all decimal places from the UI except for the chance for an event bro event.

	#Bug Fixes
	* Fixed issue where some events would display many decimal places.
	* Fixed issue where the "On Cooldown" events had incorrect values for Fired On Day and Available On Day.
	* Added Blighted Guy 1 event to the list of bro events that have a partial success chance to reward a bro when the event fires.
	* Fixed issue where crises events were always obscured, regardless of MSU Setting.
	* Fixed issue where some bro events that include the word 'crises' were being obfuscated.

	#Vanilla Fixes
	* Vanilla does not remove an event from the cooldown 'pile' until it qualifies to fire again. So, events will stay on the On Cooldown tab even though they are technically no longer on cooldown. You would need to qualify for that event again and then it would be cleared.


	Something interesting that I've discovered while working on the event manager mod days / time of day. There are two clocks running behind the scenes. A virtual clock that is tied to things like events. A world map clock that is visual to the player. These two clocks grow further apart over time.

	todo
	* Add logic to process events in the cooldown list
	* Create tooltips
	* Fix issue where the filter box arrests attention away from the keybinds
	* Create event library
