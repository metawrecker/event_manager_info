I created this Battle Brothers mod because the entire event system in the game is a black box. Someone did add events to the Battle Brothers Fandom wiki but the searching method is cumbersome and it's a large undertaking to try to figure out what events you qualify for at any given time of your run. 
- This mod was written with a special focus on Event Brother events; namely events that may reward a brother to your company. But, if you are trying to qualify for a different event, you can use this mod for that purpose as well.
- This mod uses the in-game Event Manager, so the events available and the events on cooldown are the exact values stored in the Event Manager.

## Features
- Event Pool
-    All events that you currently qualify for will appear here. Brother and Dog events get fun extra icons.
- On Cooldown
-    All events that are on cooldown, sorted from smallest to largest "Fired On Day" value.
