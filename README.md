## Event Info
I created this Battle Brothers mod because the entire event system in the game is a black box. Someone did add events to the Battle Brothers Fandom wiki but the searching method is cumbersome and it's a large undertaking to try to figure out what events you qualify for at any given time of your run. 
- This mod was written with a special focus on Event Brother events; namely events that may reward a brother to your company. But, if you are trying to qualify for a different event, you can use this mod for that purpose as well.
- This mod uses the in-game Event Manager, so the events available and the events on cooldown are the exact values stored in the Event Manager.

## Features
- Event Pool
-  All events that you currently qualify for

### Does this mod change vanilla behavior?
- There are NO code changes to how vanilla's event system works. This is an 'info only' mod.

### How does it work?
* Press Ctrl+e to open the events popup window. You can change this keybind in the Mod Settings folder.
*  You can change this keybind in the MSU Mod Settings.
- Explore the MSU Mod Settings menu for settings that impact the filters and crises event masking.

### Pre-requisites
